## Database Tables (Supabase)

```
levels               — Consultant hierarchy (Analyst → Partner/MD), billing rates
skill_sets           — Practice areas + technologies (P2P, O2C, NetSuite, etc.)
consultants          — Employee master (name, level, location, capacity, rates)
consultant_skill_sets — Many-to-many: consultant → skills
clients              — Client names
projects             — Engagements (name, status, probability, dates, client)
resource_assignments — Supply: one row per consultant + project + week_ending + hours
needs                — Demand: open role requirements (level, hours/week, date range)
                        closed_at TIMESTAMPTZ + closed_reason TEXT ('met'|'abandoned') — NULL = open
need_skill_sets      — Many-to-many: need → required skills
```

All tables have RLS filtering by `tenant_id` (from JWT `app_metadata`).

**Two Supabase clients**:
- `serviceClient` — service role key, bypasses RLS, server-side only
- `getClient(userToken)` — per-request JWT, RLS enforced

## Role-Based Access

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| `admin` | Full access including user management |
| `resource_manager` | Full data access, edit staffing/consultants, no user management |
| `project_manager` | Read-only on staffing; can view consultant profiles |
| `executive` | Read-only dashboard + heatmap |
| `consultant` | Sees only own heatmap row |

Enforced via `requireRole()` middleware on sensitive routes.

---

## Frontend Architecture

**No framework — vanilla JS.** All state is module-level globals in `app.js`:
- `currentUserRole` — from `/api/auth/me`
- `rawData` — cached dashboard/heatmap response
- `_hmExpanded` — Set of expanded employee names in heatmap
- `_pendingStaffing` — Map of unsaved inline edits (`${empName}||${weekLabel}||${project}`)
- `_editActiveCell` — currently focused heatmap cell
- `_needsStatusFilter` — active donut chart filter
- `_settingsActivePanel` — active Settings sub-nav panel ('consultants' | 'users')

**Settings tab** uses a left sub-nav (Consultants first, Users second). Consultants visible to admin + resource_manager; Users visible to admin only. `switchSettingsPanel()` handles nav highlight + panel swap.

**Heatmap** uses virtual scrolling (renders only visible rows) to handle 40+ employees. Cells support keyboard nav (Tab/Enter/Arrow keys).

**Charts**: Chart.js instances stored in `charts` object, reused across re-renders.

## Heatmap Color Coding

| Hours | Class | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| 0–10h | hm-bench | Red | Bench / urgent |
| 11–44h | hm-partial | Yellow | Partial utilization |
| 45h | hm-utilized | Green | Perfect utilization |
| 46h+ | hm-over | Orange | Overallocated |

## Data Shape from `readStaffingData()`

This is the central data structure passed to all aggregation logic:

```javascript
{
  supply: [{ employeeName, level, skillSet, allSkillSets, projectAssigned,
             projectStatus, isBillable, weeklyHours: { "Week ending 3/7": 40 },
             _consultantId, _projectId }],
  demand: [{ projectName, clientName, projectStatus, probability, resourceLevel,
             skillSet, allSkillSets, startDate, endDate, hoursPerWeek, _needId, _projectId }],
  employees: [{ employeeName, level, isBillable }],
  skills: [{ skillSet, type }],
  resourceLevels: [{ level }],
  projects: [{ projectId, projectName, status, probability, clientName }],
  _meta: { weekKeys, weekKeyToDate, levelById, skillSetById,
           consultantById, consultantByName, projectById, projectByName }
}
```

Week keys format: `"Week ending M/D"` (e.g. `"Week ending 3/7"`). Stored in DB as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Conventions & Patterns

- **Server writes**: Always go through `supabaseReader.js` functions, not inline SQL in routes
- **Auth on every route**: Use `requireAuth` middleware; add `requireRole(...)` for writes
- **Week date math**: Use `_meta.weekKeyToDate` to convert display labels to ISO dates
- **Inline edits**: Saved immediately on cell blur/Enter; `_pendingStaffing` tracks unsaved changes
- **SSE broadcast**: Call `broadcast({ type: 'consultant-updated', ... })` after any consultant mutation
- **Claude context**: Built in `claudeService.js`; includes 12-week window, employee skills/levels, demand roles
- **Sessions**: In-memory (MemoryStore) — lost on server restart in dev; acceptable for Railway single-instance
- **Session docs**: At the end of each session, create `docs/session-XX/` containing `HANDOFF_vXX.md` (new handoff) and a snapshot copy of `CLAUDE.md`. The root `CLAUDE.md` is the live version read at session start; `docs/session-XX/CLAUDE.md` is the point-in-time archive.

## Critical Rules — Never Revert

These decisions were made deliberately to fix hard-to-debug bugs. Do not revert them.

- **serviceClient on all write paths** — `resolveConsultantId`, `resolveProjectId`, `upsertAssignment`, `deleteAssignments`, `acceptMatch()`, `updateNeed()`, `replaceNeedSkillSets()` all use `serviceClient`. RLS blocks user JWT on write paths. Never switch to user JWT.
- **data-cid pattern** — all consultant name references in DOM use `data-cid` attributes. Never pass consultant names as inline JS string literals. Handles apostrophe names (e.g. Delaney O'Neil) correctly.
- **allSkillSets.includes() for matching** — recommendations engine matches against full `allSkillSets` array, not primary skill only. `empWeekMap` stores `allSkillSets` array. Never revert to primary-only matching.
- **Recommendations engine: candidates must match level + any skill (`allSkillSets.includes`)** — Availability calculated as average available hours within the need's start-to-end date window only (not full 12-week rolling window). Included if avgAvailable > 0. Capped at `hoursNeeded` in response. Sorted by `availableHours` desc. Badge: green ≥100%, yellow 50-99%, coral <50%. Do not reintroduce a hard per-week qualifying gate or minimum availability threshold.
- **parseDateStr 2-digit year fix** — `if yr < 100 → yr += 2000`. Prevents date parsing failures.
- **acceptMatch() is async** — writes to Supabase before updating UI. Date range guard: never write 0h rows outside engagement start/end dates.
- **Cache busters must be incremented on every deploy with frontend changes** — `app.js` and `styles.css` both carry `?v=N` query strings in `index.html`. Current: `app.js?v=102`, `styles.css?v=52`.
- **/api/dashboard and /api/heatmap use serviceClient** — not user JWT. Required after RLS tightening. Do not revert.
- **Drilldown modals open expanded by default** — all consultant group sections open on load + Expand/Collapse All button above rows, left-aligned.
- **Enter key navigation in heatmap** — while loop skips consultants with no project sub-rows. Polling pattern (setInterval 50ms, 20 attempts) for post-render DOM queries.
- **Need lifecycle uses closed_at IS NULL** — `readStaffingData()` filters `.is('closed_at', null)`. Auto-close (reason='met') fires in `checkAndAutoCloseNeeds()` after every `acceptMatch()` write. Manual close (reason='abandoned') via `POST /api/needs/:id/close`. All close writes use `serviceClient`.
- **Needs donut chart segments by client** — each segment = one client, sized by open need count. Urgency badges on rows (Urgent ≤2wk, Soon 2-4wk, Planned 4+wk) computed client-side from `startDate`. No coverage status computation on server or client. `_needsClientFilter` (not `_needsStatusFilter`) drives donut click filtering. Do not reintroduce partially_met/unmet/fully_met.
- **Settings nav defaults to Consultants** — both admin and resource_manager see Consultants panel first. `_settingsActivePanel` persists across tab switches.
- **Quick Fill always uses API path (POST /api/save-staffing)** — DOM fast path was removed. Never reintroduce DOM cell matching for Quick Fill.

## UI Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+1–5` | Switch tabs |

## Known Limitations

- Sessions not persisted across server restarts (MemoryStore)
- No drag-and-drop staffing reassignment
- No email notifications
- TENANT_ID is hard-coded per deployment (not parameterized for multi-tenant SaaS)
- Excel import script (`import-to-supabase.js`) is one-time only

## Build Order

### V2 — Ship it (3 issues)
1. **#154 — UI/UX polished for pilot launch** ← next
2. **#187 — AI recommendations load fast enough for daily use**
3. **#168 — All roles verified before real users onboard** (gate — final UAT sweep)

### Pilot — Internal adoption (after V2)
Gate: do NOT start V3 until 2-4 weeks of pilot feedback collected.
- #182 — In-app onboarding tour
- #183 — Contextual tooltips
- #184 — Admin getting-started checklist
- #185 — In-app feedback button (Supabase-backed)
- #186 — Switch prod to real data

### V3 — First external customer (after Pilot)
Gate: at least 3 unsolicited feature requests from pilot users.
- #96 — Tenant onboarding
- #97 — Extended roles
- #118 — Audit log
- #172 — Client hierarchy
